# The program utilizes the OpenWeather API to fetch weather data for a specific location identified by a ZIP code and country code. The user provides an API key, ZIP code, country code, and the number of days for which they want to retrieve the weather forecast. The program then constructs a URL using the provided information and makes a request to the OpenWeather API. Upon receiving the response, the program parses the JSON data to extract the weather information, specifically the temperature at different time intervals over the specified number of days. It then plots this temperature data against the dates to visualize the temperature trend over the selected period.
By using the WeatherPlotter class, the program encapsulates the functionality for fetching weather data and plotting temperatures, making it easy to reuse and maintain. The fetch_weather_data method handles the API request and data retrieval, while the plot_temperatures method processes the data and generates a plot using Matplotlib. This approach allows users to quickly obtain and visualize weather forecast data for a specific location, aiding in decision-making or simply providing insight into upcoming weather patterns.
